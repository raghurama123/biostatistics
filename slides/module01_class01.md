# Module 1: Introduction to Biostatistics and Data Description

---

## What is Biostatistics?
Biostatistics deals with the application of statistical methods to biological problems.  
**Biostatistics = Statistics for Biology**

<small>

In physics or chemistry:  
- Variation is mostly due to **experimental error**. 
- Averaging over repeated measurements on the **same sample** eliminates variance.

In biology:  
- We study **naturally varying populations** (organisms, cells, patients).  
- This **biological variation** is a meaningful phenomenon‚Äînot error.  
- We must go **beyond repeated measurements** to understand:  
  - Genetic differences  
  - Environmental effects  
  - _Random_ biological processes

> Biostatistics helps us to do statstics while accounting for biological variation‚Äînot eliminate it.
