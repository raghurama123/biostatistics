# Module 1: Introduction to Biostatistics and Data Description

---

## What is Biostatistics?
Biostatistics deals with the application of statistical methods to biological problems.  
**Biostatistics = Biology + Statistics**

---

## Why can't we just call it Statistics?

In fields like physics or chemistry:
- Repeated measurements on the **same sample** tend to yield **consistent results**.
- Variation is often due to **instrumental or experimental error**, which can be minimized by averaging.

In biology:
- We often deal with **populations of individuals** (cells, organisms, patients) that differ **naturally**.
- This **biological variation** is not an error—it's the **core subject** of study.
- Hence, we need **statistical methods that go beyond repeated measurements** to account for:
  - Genetic diversity
  - Environmental influences
  - Random biological processes

> Biostatistics is not just about precision—it’s about making sense of variation in living systems.
